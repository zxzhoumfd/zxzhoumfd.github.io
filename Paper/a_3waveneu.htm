For the 2+1 dimensional three-wave equation, by using the known
nonlinear constraints from 2+1 dimensions to 1+1 dimensions, we
reduce it further to 0+1 dimensional (finite dimensional)
Hamiltonian systems with constraints of Neumann type. These
Hamiltonian systems are proved to be Liouville integrable by
finding a full set of involutive conserved integrals and proving
their functional independence. Moreover, almost-periodic
solutions of the 2+1 dimensional three-wave equation are obtained
by solving these Hamiltonian systems explicitly.
