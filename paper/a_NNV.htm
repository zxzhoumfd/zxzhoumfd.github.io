A Lax system in three variables is presented, two equations of which
form the Lax pair of the stationary Davey-Stewartson II
equation. With certain nonlinear constraints, the full
integrability condition of this Lax system contains the hyperbolic
Nizhnik-Novikov-Veselov equation and its standard Lax pair. The
Darboux transformation for the Davey-Stewartson II
equation is used to solve the hyperbolic Nizhnik-Novikov-Veselov
equation and global multi-soliton solutions are obtained. It is
proved that the <I>nxn</I> soliton solution derived by the Darboux
transformation of order <I>n</I> approaches zero uniformly and
exponentially at spatial infinity and is asymptotic to <I>n<SUP>2</SUP></I>
solitons at temporal infinity.
