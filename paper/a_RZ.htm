The Darboux transformation method is useful in getting explicit
solutions of integrable systems. When the system has no symmetries
(i.e., all the entries of the coefficients of the Lax pair are
independent), the construction of Darboux transformation is well
known, which was given by Neugebauer and Meinel for 2x2
systems, then by Gu, Sattinger and Zurkowski for general systems.
However, in practice, there should be some symmetries. To keep all
these symmetries, the construction is much more difficult. In this
chapter, we shall first review the general construction of Darboux
transformation for systems without symmetries. Then the Darboux
transformation for systems with unitary symmetry is discussed. The
equivalent construction given by Zakharov and Mikhailov is also
reviewed. By analyzing the spectrum, soliton solutions and breather
solutions of MKdV equation are obtained. Finally, the Darboux
transformation for a two-dimensional affine Toda equation, which has
more complicated symmetries, is constructed.<P>
