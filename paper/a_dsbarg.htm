The Davey-Stewartson I equation is a typical integrable 
equation in 2+1 dimensions. Its Lax system being essentially 
in 1+1 dimensional form has been found through nonlinearization 
from 2+1 dimensions to 1+1 dimensions. In the present paper,
this essentially 1+1 dimensional Lax system is further
nonlinearized into 1+0 dimensional Hamiltonian systems by taking
the Bargmann constraints. It is shown that the resulting 1+0
dimensional Hamiltonian systems are completely integrable in
Liouville sense by finding a full set of integrals of motion and
proving their functional independence.<P>
