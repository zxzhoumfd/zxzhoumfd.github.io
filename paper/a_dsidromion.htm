<FONT SIZE=+1>A PT-symmetric nonlocal Davey-Stewartson I equation is considered,
in which $\bar u(x,y,t)$ in the classical equation is replaced by
$\bar u(-x,-y,t)$. Using the nonlinear constraint from 2+1
dimensions to 1+1 dimensions and Darboux transformation in 1+1
dimensions, 2m x 2n dromion solutions are obtained. It is
proved that under certain conditions, the derived solutions are
always globally defined and decay exponentially at spacial infinity.
Moreover, each asymptotic solution as t tends to infinity has exactly
4mn peaks. The local behavior of each peak is also given.<P>
