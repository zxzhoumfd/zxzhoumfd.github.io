For the Davey-Stewartson I equation, which is an integrable
equation in 1+2 dimensions, we have already found its Lax pair in
1+1 dimensional form by nonlinear constraints. This paper deals
with the second nonlinearization of this 1+1 dimensional system to
get three 1+0 dimensional Hamiltonian systems with a constraint of
Neumann type. The full set of involutive conserved integrals is
obtained and their functional independence is proved. Therefore,
the Hamiltonian systems are completely integrable in Liouville
sense. A periodic solution of the Davey-Stewartson I equation is
obtained by solving these classical Hamiltonian systems as an
example.
