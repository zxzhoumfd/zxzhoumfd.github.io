For the nonlocal Davey-Stewartson I equation, the Darboux
transformation is considered and explicit expressions of the
solutions are obtained. Like other nonlocal equations, many
solutions of this equation may have singularities. However, by
suitable choice of parameters in the solutions of the Lax pair, it
is proved that the solutions obtained from seed solutions which are
zero and an exponential function of <I>t</I>  respectively, by a Darboux
transformation of degree <I>n</I> are global solutions of the nonlocal
Davey-Stewartson I equation. The derived solutions are soliton
solutions when the seed solution is zero, in the sense that they are
bounded and have <I>n</I> peaks, and "dark cross soliton" solutions
when the seed solution is an exponential function of <I>t</I>, in the
sense that they are bounded and their norms change fast along some
crossing straight lines.<P>
