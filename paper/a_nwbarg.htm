Binary symmetry constraints of the N-wave interaction equations 
in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions are proposed to reduce 
the N-wave interaction equations
into finite-dimensional Liouville integrable systems. 
A new involutive and functionally independent system 
of polynomial functions is generated from an arbitrary order square
matrix Lax operator and 
used to show the Liouville integrability of the 
constrained flows of the N-wave interaction equations. 
The constraints on the potentials resulting from 
the symmetry constraints 
give rise to involutive solutions to 
the N-wave interaction equations,
and thus the integrability by quadratures are shown for 
the N-wave interaction equations
by the constrained flows.
