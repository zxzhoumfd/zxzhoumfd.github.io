For finite dimensional Hamiltonian systems derived from 1+1
dimensional integrable systems, if they have Lax representations,
then the Lax operator creates a set of conserved integrals. When
these conserved integrals are in involution, it is believed quite
popularly that there will be enough functionally independent ones
among them to guarantee the Liouville integrability of the
Hamiltonian systems, at least for those derived from physical
problems. In this paper, we give a counterexample based on the
<I>U(2)</I> principal chiral field. It is proved that the finite
dimensional Hamiltonian systems derived from the <I>U(2)</I> principal
chiral field are Liouville integrable. Moreover, their Lax
operator gives a set of involutive conserved integrals, but they
are not enough to guarantee the integrability of the Hamiltonian systems.
