For the integrable system with u(p,q) reduction, there is a
well-known sufficient condition to choose the parameters: the
spectral parameters only take two mutually conjugate values and the
solutions of the Lax pair should satisfy certain orthogonal
relations. In this paper, we prove that, for the AKNS system, the
Kaup-Newell system and the principal chiral field (PCF), this
condition is also necessary for generic potentials with the u(p,q)
reduction. For some other reductions, sufficiency and necessity
of more constraints are proved.
