For the 1 + 1 dimensional Lax pair with a symplectic symmetry and cyclic
symmetries, it is shown that there is a natural finite-dimensional Hamiltonian
system related to it by presenting a unified Lax matrix. The Liouville
integrability of the derived finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems is proved
in a unified way. Any solution of these Hamiltonian systems gives a solution
of the original PDE. As an application, the two-dimensional hyperbolic C<sub>n</sub><sup>(1)</sup>
Toda equation is considered and the finite-dimensional integrable Hamiltonian
system related to it is obtained from the general results.<P>
