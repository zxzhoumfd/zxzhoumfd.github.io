The Yang-Mills-Higgs-Bogomolny equations in both 2+1 dimensional Minkowski space-time
and anti-de Sitter space-time are known to be integrable and their soliton solutions
have already been obtained. In this paper we show that there is a
natural relation between the Lax pairs and soliton solutions in
these two space-times  when the curvature changes from 0 to
-1. The change of the asymptotic behaviors of the solitons are
also discussed.
